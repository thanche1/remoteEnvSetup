

Step 1
Download Python 3.7 version (Anaconda 2019.10) for Linux Installer
	https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/

Step 2
Install anaconda
	sudo chmod +x Anaconda3-4.3.0-Linux-x86_64.sh
	sudo ./Anaconda3-4.3.0-Linux-x86_64.sh
	bash Anaconda3-2019.09.rc5-Linux-x86_64.sh

Step 3
Set conda path to .bashrc
	export PATH=~/anaconda3/bin:$PATH
source .bashrc

Step 4
Create conda env
	conda create -n envName --clone root

Then follow steps bellow--->
vi 


If you want install python libs and their dependencies offline, finish following these steps on a machine with the same os, network connected, and python installed:

1) Create a requirements.txt file with similar content (Note - these are the libraries you wish to download):

Flask==0.12
requests>=2.7.0
scikit-learn==0.19.1
numpy==1.14.3
pandas==0.22.0

One option for creating the requirements file is to use pip freeze > requirements.txt. This will list all libraries in your environment. Then you can go in to requirements.txt and remove un-needed ones.

2) Execute command mkdir wheelhouse && pip download -r requirements.txt -d wheelhouse to download libs and their dependencies to directory wheelhouse

3) Copy requirements.txt into wheelhouse directory

4) Archive wheelhouse into wheelhouse.tar.gz with tar -zcf wheelhouse.tar.gz wheelhouse

Then upload wheelhouse.tar.gz to your target machine:

1) Execute tar -zxf wheelhouse.tar.gz to extract the files

2) Execute pip install -r wheelhouse/requirements.txt --no-index --find-links wheelhouse to install the libs and their dependencies



*** Also install conda with bash before everything and also create an env with (conda create -n env1 --clone root)
